# Connect to YouFibre / Netomnia XGS-PON with the WAS-110

<!--![Connect to YouFibre](shared-assets/youfibre_was_110.webp){ class="nolightbox" }-->

<!-- more -->
<!-- nocont -->

## What you need

- A [WAS-110] module, preferably pre-flashed with [8311 firmware](https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder)
- SC/APC to LC/APC cable or coupler (check which side your socket terminates with). My YouFibre install came **pre-terminated with SC/APC**, which fits directly into the WAS-110. No extra patch cables or adapters were needed.
- Your provisioned **PON Serial Number**
- A router or firewall (e.g. OPNsense) with SFP+ WAN (or an isolated VLAN for WAN)
- Optional: ability to clone MAC address (for static IP assignment from YouFibre)

!!! question "Do I need to flash the firmware?"
    This guide assumes your module comes preloaded with 8311 firmware. Flashing instructions are available separately.

## Configuration overview

Once the WAS-110 is connected to your fiber socket and inserted into an SFP+ port, follow these steps:

### 1. Access the 8311 web UI

- Assign your PC an IP like `192.168.11.3/24`
- Connect directly or via switch to the ONT
- Navigate to: `https://192.168.11.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/8311/config`

!!! bug "Empty VLAN table or no WAN IP?"
    Disable `Fix VLANs` under the *ISP Fixes* tab and reboot. Without this, DHCP may silently fail.

## Real-world usage notes

### ðŸ’¬ My user report

> I managed to get PLOAM to O5.1 (Associated), but my OPNsense WAN didnâ€™t get a DHCP IP until I:
>
> - Disabled `Fix VLANs`
> - Rebooted OPNsense
>

> The 8311 UI was unaccessible after moving it into the WAN VLAN, tried adding a static route but no use.

> I successfully replaced the ISP ADTRAN SDX621i ONT.

## Performance

Running at **1 Gbps symmetric**, reports:

> I saw about a 50 Mbps increase in speed, though the main win was space-saving in the network cabinet by eliminating the external ONT.
